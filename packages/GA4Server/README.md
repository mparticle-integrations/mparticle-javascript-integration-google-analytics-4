# mParticle Google Analytis 4 Server Side Kit Integration

Google's server side API for GA4 requires a `client_id` which still necessitates loading Google's SDK. In this kit, mParticle loads the SDK, collects the `client_id`, and sends this as an integration attribute to our server to include it on events sent to GA4.

# Usage
JS kits are automatically included with your mParticle.js file when loading mParticle via the [snippet](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/getting-started/#add-the-sdk-snippet).

If loading mParticle via [npm](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/web/self-hosting/), you will have to manually include the server side GA4 kit via npm:

```
npm i @mparticle/web-google-analytics-4-server-kit
```

Full documentation on usage can be found [here](https://docs.mparticle.com/integrations/google-analytics-4/event/).
